# Resume
> LaTeX code generated at [resumake.io](https://resumake.io)

This is my working resume file using a template generated on [resumake.io](https://resumake.io).

If you want to fork this, make sure you have texlive installed on your machine. It uses a [gulp package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-latex) that leverages that to generate a pdf. The pdf is in this repo as resume.pdf.

<!-- ## Original readme text

## Usage
To generate a PDF from this LaTeX code, navigate to this folder in a terminal and run:

    xelatex resume.tex

## Requirements
You will need to have `xelatex` installed on your machine.

Alternatively, you can use a site like [ShareLaTeX](https://sharelatex.com) to build and edit your LaTeX instead. -->
